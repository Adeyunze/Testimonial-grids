            <p class="rev">" I was an EMT for many yers before i joined bootcamp. I've been looking to make a transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. i signed up fior the free intro course and found it incredibly fun!! i enrolled shortly
                thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best-and most grueling-time of my life. since completing the course. I've succesfully switched careers' working as a Software Engineer at VR startup."

            <h3>Such a life-changing experience. Highly recommended!</h3>
            <p class="rev">"Before joining bootcamp,I've never written a line of code. I needed some structure from proffesionals who can help me learn programming step by step, i was encouraged to enroll by a former student of theirs who can only say wonderful things
                about program. The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. they were very hands-on and i never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team project, in paticular was outstanding. it took my learning to the next level in a way
                that no tutorial could ever have. in fact, I've always referred to it during interviews as an example of my development experience, it certainly helped me land a job as a fullstack developer after recieving multiple offers, 100% recommended!"
